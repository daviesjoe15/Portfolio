        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>I was employed as an intern for 1 year at (AP Diving) a diving equipment company. One of my projects was to redesign their dive computer interface, a wrist-mounted computer that monitors critical aspects of the diver's equipment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>

        <p>I was asked to redesign the existing computer display with a new LCD colour screen because the company was behind in this market area.</p>

        <p>The software was to remain the same thus restricting the screen to four stacked 56-pixel bands and with the added constraint that no two colours may touch.</p>

        <p>The company is recognised for its world-class equipment however it was common knowledge in the dive community that our computer was outdated.</p>

    </figure>

    
     <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Research</h3>

        <p>I found that existing dive computer UI's were far more advanced than ours and demonstrated a heavy use of skeuomorphic design techniques. </p>

        <p>Appleâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines prooved that in fact, competitive dive computers were not using best interface practices and that taking away distractions where possible would help with the interpretation of data. It was also evident that Apple made excellent use of visual hierarchy and company colours to help deliver meaning.</p>
        
        <p>One thing remained obvious and that is the fact that the computer is essential to the diver's life, therefore the clarity of information was the highest priority.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Design</h3>

        <p>I asked the in-house divers to prioritise what information they would like to know on a typical dive and how often they need to know it.</p>
        
        <p>I used the Helvetica typeface for better readability and ensured that the type met WCAG accessibility guidelines.</p>
        
        <p>I embraced the AP Diving signature yellow as an opportunity to highlight important information, green for good and red for warnings.</p>
     </div>
        
        <img src="img/ap_diving/ap%203%20default.png" class="img-fluid image">
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The main users of our equipment were male between 30 and 60 years. Interestingly almost 10% of males in that age bracket are colour blind.</p>
            
            <p>I created different themes for different users preferences including one for colour blind users.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">
          I also had to design a complimentary screen for the AP HUS (Head-Up Screen) offering an intuitive and consistent experience for existing customer divers.

        <h3>To Market</h3>

        <p>In order to make an impact in the dive community, I worked with the graphic designer to create a video animation that would blow the competition out the park. I created the CAD, renderings and animation for this project.</p>

        <h3>Result</h3>

          <p>DIVER Magazine placed the Vision2020 Handset in 3rd place as 'Product of the Year' out of an impressive lineup of products.</p>

        <h3>Take-away</h3>

        <p>This was my first interface design task and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
        
         <p>If I were to do it again I would prototype the interface for testing.</p>
