        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>ProGolfMe is an app that connects golf coaches with golf players where the players can pay for in-app lessons and performance feedback.</p>

        <p>The golf player can video their swing and send it to any golf coach of their choice. The coach will then return a video message giving them pointers. Simple right..!?</p>
    </div>

    <img src="img/pgm/1%20pgm.jpg" class="img-fluid image">

    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>The Problems</h3>

        <p>ProGolfMe required an MVP (minimal viable product) within 3 months and wanted to be capable of generating revenue within 6 months.</p>

        <p>At this stage, ProGolfMe had no branding or app designs, just a logo.</p>

        <p>Communicating with the user what needed to be done in the app was evidently going to be a challenge.</p>
    </div>
    
     <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Research</h3>

        <p>Using the existing logo, I generated two colour palettes and logo variations.
        I contacted hundreds of golfers through a golf forum and simply held a poll to see what was the preferred brand style.</p>

        <p>Discussions with golf coaches early on revealed that they also wanted access via an app because it would be easier to take and send videos.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Testing</h3>

        <p>Visits to the local golf club to test prototypes revealed a lack of clarity and disjointed user flows. </p>
     </div>
        
        <img src="img/pgm/testing%20-%20pgm.jpg" class="img-fluid image">
        
        <p class="paragraph">At this stage I suggested it would be beneficial to do our work at the golf club to test more frequently with a fail fast approach, this strategy was approved and consequently, we gained deeper insights.</p>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Design</h3>

        <p>I developed the company branding and with it a cohesive style guide.</p>
    </div>
    
    <img src="img/pgm/styleguide%20-%20pgm.jpg" class="img-fluid image">
    
     
    <p class="paragraph">I drafted detailed wireframes to achieve a polished product ready for release.</p>
    
    <img src="img/pgm/wireframes%20-%20pgm.jpg" class="img-fluid image">
    
     
    <p class="paragraph">I developed a simple flow that was intuitive and provided a far higher success rate for all age brackets compared with the MVP.</p>

    <img src="img/pgm/laptop%20-%20pgm.jpg" class="img-fluid image">
    
     <p class="paragraph">The coaches had demanded an app experience, therefore I was able to strategically design the app to share assets and app architecture. I made the primary colour different so that it was obvious which app you were using.</p>

      <figure>User account and Coach account</figure>
       </figcaption>
    
        <div class="paragraph">

        <p>By simplifying the navigation into three categories, Profile, Chat and Browse Coaches I helped reduce the cognitive load.</p>

         <p>I covered the whole app experience from sign-up to payment.</p> 

        <p>Meticulous design communication between myself and app developers in Ukraine was critical for the successful launch of the app.</p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>

        <p>Our MVP was in the App Store on target. By 5 months we had people using the app due to its improved architecture and user flows.</p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>

          <p>I learned how to play golf! üèå</p>
          
          <p>I learned that how one approaches user testing directly affects the quality of the insights obtained.</p>
          
        <p>If I were to do it again, I would not just copy best practices but take the time to fully understand why they work in order to apply them with more meaning.</p>

        <h3>Testimony</h3>

        <p>"Joe was a credit to the successful development of our product. He listened to our needs and shared creative ideas and opportunities that evolved into crucial components of our app. He is a team player that understands the limitations in programming and business decisions yet always finds a workaround with techniques such as user testing or product research. If you're trying to build a software product that your users love, Joe will certainly help you get there and probably save you money to boot." Brendan (Founder)</p>
