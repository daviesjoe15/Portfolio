                <p class="mb-6">When I was 15, my mum turned deaf and it seemed as though we wouldn't be able to share a normal conversation again. Six years later she was given something called a cochlear implant, which enabled her to learn to hear all over again. The device was successful and as a result had a tremendous impact on my family's lives and she has been able to continue her career as a nurse. I feel we are only just beginning to use design to make a positive impact on peoples lives and I'm excited to be a part it. </p>
                <p class="mb-6">When I'm not designing, you will likely find me outdoors, either surfing, biking or climbing.</p>
